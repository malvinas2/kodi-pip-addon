**It is __highly recommended__ to use a ramdisk as temporary folder where the ffmpeg-captured images are stored!**
**If you do not use a ramdisk your lifetime of your harddisc will suffer!**

## Description
PIP kodi addon provides a picture in picture feature for television channels from a tvheadend PVR server.
          
## Usage

### Show and hide picture in picture
* if a user defined key (shift+p) is pressed during television channel is displayed a picture in picture window is created at a definable position.
* if the channel is switched to another channel the picture stays at configured position and shows with some frames per second a new snapshot image of the previous channel where "p" key was pressed.

### Hide picture in picture
* if the user defined key (shift+p) is pressed a second time the picture in picuture windows is hidden again and the player is switched back to the inital channel.
* if another user defined key (shift+b) is pressed the picture in picture channel is hidden and the current channel is kept.

## Installation
* see releases: https://github.com/mltobi/kodi-pip-addon/releases

## How it works

### Function
* service addon "script.service.pip"
  * monitor detects a notifyAll event on the user defined keys
  * requests a rpccmd to get the current channel name of the current displaced channel
  * evals channel list file from tvheadend server and creates a lookup dictionary "channel name/label" -> "url link"
  * starts a ffmpeg process with the url (on first key press)
  * creates windows handle to add an image control
  * image control is update with new captured images
  * stops a ffmpeg process (on second key press)

### Parameters
* PIP settings: position and size of image
* Tvheadend settings: username, password, server address and port
* Temporay folder to store the captured images (on linux /dev/shm is used because it is a user accessible ramdisk)
  * It is **highly recommended** to use a ramdisk as temporary folder where the ffmpeg-captured images are stored!
    * every captured image is stored to the temporary folder!
    * **if you do not use a ramdisk your lifetime of your harddisc will suffer!**
* Key definition (results in a keymap.xml file)

### M3U file format
The m3u file downloaded from tvheadend server needs to have the following format:
```
#EXTINF:-1 logo="..." tvg-id="..." tvg-chno="1",Das Erste HD
http://192.168.1.1:9981/stream/channelid/....?profile=pass
```
